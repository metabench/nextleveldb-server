// Active-Table will be useful for adding new records
//  It's possible for an Active Table to have its own records, active or inactive.

// Want to make it so that Active Table is an efficient interface for interacting with datasets.

// Will also be able to get data in the required formats through Active Table. Could have some data structures available on the Server. Probably keep them out of the Model?
//  May well want to download multi-MB chuncks of tightly packed binary Typed Array data, then process it very quickly upon arrival.
